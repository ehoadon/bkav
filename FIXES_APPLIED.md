# CDN and Performance Issues Fixed

## Issues Resolved:

### 1. **CDN Integrity Errors**
- ❌ Fixed integrity attribute parsing errors
- ❌ Removed problematic integrity hashes that were causing CORS issues
- ✅ Updated to reliable CDN sources (unpkg.com for XLSX, jsDelivr for Chart.js)

### 2. **JavaScript Library Loading**
- ❌ Fixed Chart.js version compatibility (updated to 3.9.1 for better stability)
- ❌ Removed problematic chartjs-adapter-date-fns that was causing module errors
- ✅ Simplified date handling with date-fns directly

### 3. **CORS Policy Issues**
- ❌ Fixed CloudFlare access redirect issues
- ✅ Used more reliable CDN endpoints that don't require special access

### 4. **Module Loading Errors**
- ❌ Fixed "Cannot use import statement outside a module" error
- ✅ Ensured proper script loading order and compatibility

## Updated CDN Links:

```html
<!-- Before (Problematic) -->
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/xlsx/0.18.5/xlsx.min.js" integrity="sha512-..." crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@4.3.0/dist/chart.min.js"></script>

<!-- After (Fixed) -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/xlsx@0.18.5/dist/xlsx.full.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@3.9.1/dist/chart.min.js"></script>
```
